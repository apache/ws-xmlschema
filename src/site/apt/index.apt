Overview
  
   XMLSchema is a lightweight Java object model that can be used to manipulate and
   generate XML schema representations. You can use it to read XML Schema (xsd) files
   into memory and analyze or modify them, or to create entirely new schemas from
   scratch.

   XMLSchema 2.0 is a major revision that takes advantage of the facilities of Java 1.5.  XMLSchema 2.3.0 requires Java8 or higher.

   For information on how to use the XmlSchema API, please
   see the {{{./xmlschema-core/apidocs/index.html}javadocs}} or the {{{./xmlschema-core/schematutorial.html}tutorial}}.

   XmlSchema eagerly welcomes suggestions, documentation,
   and most of all code. Please join our dev list, submit JIRA entries, and
   attach patches.

Issues

   Note that historical JIRA issues for XmlSchema are in the WSCOMMONS project, while 
   new issues are in the XMLSCHEMA project.

Downloads

   Most users incorporate XML Schema via maven. You can also download release packages
   from {{{./download.html}downloads}}.
