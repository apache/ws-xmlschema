<section name="Obtain the Apache XMLSchema&#8482; distribution">
<p> 
XMLSchema is a lightweight Java object model that can be used to manipulate
and generate XML schema representations. You can use it to read XML Schema
(xsd) files into memory and analyze or modify them, or to create entirely new
schemas from scratch.
</p>
<subsection name="How to Download">
<p>

our mirrors. It is good practice to verify the integrity of the distribution
files. Apache XMLSchema releases are available under the 
<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</a> - see the 
LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files contained in each release artifact.

<subsection name="Verifying Releases">
<p>
When downloading from a mirror please check the (SHA-512) checksums as well
as verifying the OpenPGP compatible signature available from the main Apache
site. The <a href="https://downloads.apache.org/ws/xmlschema/KEYS">KEYS</a> file
contains the public keys used for signing the release. It is recommended that a
web of trust is used to confirm the identity of these keys.
</p>
<p>
You can check the OpenPGP compatible signature with GnuPG via:
<ul>
<li>gpg --import KEYS</li>
<li>gpg --verify xmlschema-*-source-release.zip.asc</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You can check the SHA-512 digests with:
<ul>
<li>sha512sum xmlschema-*-source-release.zip (and compare output to xmlschema-*-source.release.zip.sha512)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<subsection name="Archive of old releases">
