 Apache XMLSchema 2.3.0 Release Notes
 ====================================

This is the release of Apache XMLSchema 2.3.0.

XMLSchema is a lightweight schema object model that can be used to manipulate 
and generate XML schema representations. It has few external dependencies
and can be easily integrated into an existing project.

You are welcome to kick the tires and get XMLSchema on the move.  Any
contribution in the form of coding, testing, submitting improvements
to the documentation, and reporting bugs are always welcome.

The primary change in this release is adding support for Java 17 and
dropping support for Java 7.   It also contains a few bug fixes:

[XMLSCHEMA-57] Fix namespace prefixes not being defined for unions
[XMLSCHEMA-59] Make setVersion public


Thanks for your interest in XMLSchema!
